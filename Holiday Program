represents aholiday during the year. This class has three instance variables:
● name, which is a String representing the name of the holiday
● day, which is an int representing the day of the month of the holiday
● month, which is a String representing the month the holiday is in
a) Write a constructor for the class Holiday, which takes a String representing the name, 
an int representing the day, and a String representing the month as its arguments, and 
sets the class variables to these values.
import java.io.*;
public class Holiday
{
String name;
int day;
String month;
public Holiday()
{
name="New year";
day=1;
month="January";
}
public Holiday(String name,int day,String month)
{
this.name=name;
this.day=day;
this.month=month;
}
public void display()
{
System.out.println("Name:"+name +"Day:"+day +"Month:"+month);
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
System.out.println("Holiday java");
Holiday h=new Holiday("RepublicDay",26,"January");
h.display();
}
